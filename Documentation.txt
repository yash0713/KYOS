
1. The OS is created for x86 architecture.

2. Booting mode used : Legacy

3. Booting disk is assumed to be floppy with sector size of 512 bytes. Hence storage is in 512byte blocks

4. addressing scheme:
	memory is divided into segments. segments overlap over each other.
	size of segment is 64k 
	segments are arrarnged in following way: 
	segment 1 starts from 0B,
	segment 2 starts from 16B, 
	segment 3 starts from 32B......
#formula: 	real address = segment*16 + offset
	same address can be calculated in multiple ways ( using different segments)

5. memory referencing:
segment: [base + index*scale + displacement]

6. All operating systems are divided into 2 parts: Bootloader and Kernel
 So far we have only written the Bootloader.
